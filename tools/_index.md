title: Tools

I have dockerized a number of open source tools for machine learning and data science. 
For each tool you will find a `docker-compose.yml`, `Dockerfile`, and an `info.yml`. 
The `info.yml` provides a standardized view of how to leverage the tool.
I have written scripts that use the information defined int he `info.yml` files to make the tools easy to use in a consistent manner.
